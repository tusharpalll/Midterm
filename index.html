    <h2>why cats are better </h2>

    <h3>1. Minimal Maintenance Requirements</h3>
    <p>Cats exhibit a higher degree of independence compared to dogs. They do not necessitate daily walks or constant supervision, rendering them particularly suitable for individuals with demanding schedules or those who prefer a more relaxed lifestyle.</p>

    <h3>2. Adaptability to Limited Spaces</h3>
    <p>Cats are well-suited to smaller living environments, such as apartments. Unlike dogs, they do not require access to a yard for exercise, making them ideal companions for urban dwellers.</p>

    <h3>3. Natural Grooming Behavior</h3>
    <p>Cats possess inherent grooming behaviors and devote considerable time to maintaining their cleanliness. This characteristic reduces the burden of hygiene maintenance on their owners.</p>

    <h3>4. Calm Companionship</h3>
    <p>Cats are generally quieter than their canine counterparts, making them excellent companions for individuals who value a tranquil atmosphere or who may have sensitivities to noise.</p>

    <h3>5. Effective Pest Management</h3>
    <p>With their instinctual hunting abilities, cats can assist in keeping homes free from pests such as rodents and insects, thereby providing an additional practical benefit beyond companionship so yeah i love cats  .</p>
